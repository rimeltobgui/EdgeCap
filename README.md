# EdgeCap
EdgeCap: Lightweight Vision-Language Model Deployment on Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB) This project deploys the EdgeCap model—a minimal generative image captioning pipeline combining TinyCLIP and distilGPT2—on a Raspberry Pi 4B with camera input. Designed for real-time, on-device inference using Ubuntu and PyTorch.
