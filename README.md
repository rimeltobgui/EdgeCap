# EdgeCap: Real-Time Image Captioning on Raspberry Pi 4B Using Lightweight Vision-Language Models
This project deploys the EdgeCap model—a minimal generative image captioning pipeline combining TinyCLIP and distilGPT2—on a Raspberry Pi 4B with camera input. Designed for real-time, on-device inference using Ubuntu and PyTorch.
